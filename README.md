My own attempt at a long context genomics model, leveraging recent advances in long context attention modeling (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">Flash Attention</a> + other hierarchical methods).

If you would like to collaborate and not averse to having the final model completely open sourced, get in touch. My goal is to simply figure out if long context is what holds us back from a new SOTA model.
